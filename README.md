# Data-Science-Experience
This is a collection of my current and ongoing data science projects and experience/ 
Happiness Project was an in class project that I completed comparing the correlations between different extraneous variables and general happiness levels as rated within the world happiness report 
Phase V and Phase IV icky are two files that are from a project that I did regarding College basketball statistics and their correlations with binary game outcomes 
Phase V is the final project and Phase IV icky is the data cleaning needed to complete the project.
